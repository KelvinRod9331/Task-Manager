            Bears, a small group of mostly large omnivorous mammals, can be found all over the world; they live in forests, mountains,
            tundra, deserts and grassy areas. Though there are different types of bear, all bear species have similarities.
            They all have stocky, fur-covered bodies; short legs; and a round head with a long snout.
        </p>
        <p> There are eight species of bear: American black bear, Asiatic black bear, brown bear, giant panda bear, polar bear,
            spectacled bear, sloth bear and sun bear, according to the International Association for Bear Research & Management.
